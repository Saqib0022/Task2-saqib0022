TITANIC-DATA- EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
This project delves into the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic through the lens of data analysis. Using the well-known Titanic dataset, we'll embark on a journey to uncover hidden patterns, understand the factors influencing passenger survival, and ultimately gain a deeper understanding of this historical event.
Project Objectives:
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
Identifying and handling missing values, inconsistencies, and data type conversions.
**Descriptive Statistics**:
Analyzing demographics, survival rates, and key features like passenger class, age, gender, and fare.
**Data Visualization**:
Employing charts and graphs to visualize relationships between variables and identify trends.
**Survival Analysis**:
Investigating factors influencing survival rates through techniques like correlation analysis and hypothesis testing.
**Predictive Modeling**:
Building a machine learning model to predict passenger survival based on variousÂ factors.
